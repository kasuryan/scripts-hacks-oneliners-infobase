# What is it ?
  * My own little reservoir of documentation i use to dip in to
  to quickly figure out a trick i might have used it in the past. In the end,
  your mind can only hold so much, so beyond that we will rely on places like
  Github to quickly access information.

  * It consists of CLI one liners/examples from various software ecosystems,
  python scripts and some others, split in various folders to keep it more
  access friendly.
